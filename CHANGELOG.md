# Change Log
All notable changes to the New Fractal Folder extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0
SASS OPTION REMOVED ðŸ˜¿
CUSTOM EXTENSIONS OPTION ADDED ðŸŽ‰

*If you were previously generating a `.scss` or `.sass` file in the Sass Extension option, you will now need to add the extension to the Custom Extensions option.*

You can now add as many file extensions as you wish. Just enter a comma seperated list in the Custom Extensions option, such as `scss,jsx,partytime`, and each will be created as a file matching the folder name.
